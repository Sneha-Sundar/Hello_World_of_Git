```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Task 1: Sampling

I first set a seed to ensure reproducibility and sample 100 values from a log normal distribution(mu = 1, sigma=0.25)

```{r}
set.seed(3)
data <- rlnorm(100,meanlog=1,sdlog=0.25)
```

## Task 2: Creating histograms

I create a histogram of the sampled data and of the sampled data on a log scale.


```{r}
hist(data,main = "Histogram of Sampled lognormal Data",xlab ="data")

hist(log(data),main = "Histogram of Sampled logNormal Data in log scale",xlab ="log(data)")

```

## Task 3: Reporting sample mean and variance of sample. 

```{r}
mean_data <- mean(data)
mean_data
var_data <- var(data)
var_data

```

The sample mean is `r mean_data` and the sample variance is `r var_data`.
